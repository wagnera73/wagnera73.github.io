I'm a computational biologist and data scientist specializing in multi-omics integration, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Currently completing my MS in Computer Science at the University of Cincinnati, I bring over six years of research experience from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, where I've led analyses at the intersection of genomics, epigenomics, and disease biology.


My research focuses on decoding complex biological systems through integrative analysis of single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptomics data. I've published in top-tier journals including Nature Communications and Science Advances, and contributed to the LungMAP consortium's publicly available lung cell atlas.


Beyond research, I develop practical tools that bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights. From building automated analysis pipelines for global research teams at Procter & Gamble to maintaining web-based genomic databases, I'm passionate about making computational biology more accessible and reproducible.
