## Research Experience

### University of Cincinnati (UC) Simulation Center, Cincinnati, OH
**Research Assistant** (through UC in conjunction with Procter & Gamble) | Aug 2024 – Dec 2025

Improved consumer analysis productivity by developing app to automate mandatory data pre-processing.

* Developed Python-based pipeline and webapp to automate noise correction, event detection, product analysis, and report generation on time-series data gathered from IoT-connected devices.
* Developed FastAPI-based UI to run algorithm and report device summary metrics.
* Collaborated with project leads to determine algorithm and UI requirements.
* Remotely assisted five global research teams in North America, Europe, and Japan to roll out the pipeline.

### Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, OH
*Jan 2016 – Present*

#### Data Analyst | May 2020 – Present

Led analysis of epigenetic regulation in LAM using single-nucleus ATAC-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, and bulk RNA-seq; applied Seurat, Python, and R to integrate and analyze multi-modal patient data; maintained a public cell atlas and published one first-author paper in a peer-reviewed journal.

* Investigated transcriptomic and epigenomic differences between control and disease state in LAM using multiple single-cell modalities to identify potential drivers of disease.
* Performed front-end and back-end developer duties by updating & maintaining a publicly available database of next-generation sequencing data as a part of the LungMAP initiative.
* Performed RNA-seq analysis and data visualization for other lab groups within CCHMC.

#### Capstone Student (for Senior Engineering Project towards BS) | Aug 2019 – May 2020

Developed method for utilizing integrated next-generation sequencing modalities to study regulatory networks inherent to cells.

* Compared networks from LAM cells with the goal of identifying functional clusters of interactions between transcription factors and target genes unique to this disease state.

#### Research Co-op Student (towards BS) | Jan 2019 – Aug 2019

Renovated open-source database using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* Performed statistical analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data using MATLAB, Python, and R.
* Back end developing experience using SQL and ORACLE.

#### Research Student | Jan 2016 – May 2016

Selected for a mentored research opportunity through the University of Cincinnati Honors Program's Biomedical Research and Mentorship program.

* Performed PCR reactions, cell transfections, RNA synthesis, DNA transformation, fluorescent microscopy, cell culture, and agarose and acrylamide gel electrophoresis.
