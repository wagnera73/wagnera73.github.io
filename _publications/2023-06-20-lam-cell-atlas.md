## Background
[The LAM Cell Atlas (LCA)](https://research.cchmc.org/pbge/lunggens/LCA/LCA.html){:target="_blank"} is a web-based cell atlas developed in partnership with the [LAM Foundation](https://www.thelamfoundation.org){:target="_blank"} that provides easy access to integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data compiled from the analysis of lung, uterus, and kidneys of patients with LAM. The LCA provides user-friendly graphical interfaces with a variety of interactive options for investigators to search, visualize, and reanalyze comprehensive single-cell omics data sets without the need for programming or coding. The LCA provides a robust data resource to test new hypotheses and discover novel biomarkers.

## My Contribution
I have contributed to the LCA by serving as web developer and full-stack engineer while maintaining the current features and adding new ones. While maintaining the website I have taken on tasks traditionally assinged to both front-end and back-end developers.

I have been responsible for maintaining and updating the design of the site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Additionally I have been tasked with maintaining the lab group's databases housing the multimodal data. I have experience using SQL with Oracle to build and optimize queries. 
 
Finally, I have experience developing Shiny apps with R and ShinyCell. These apps are hosted on the LCA and expand the websites capabilities to allow researchers a more integrated approach to explore the data gathered by the LAM Foundation.
