## Background
This paper details the construction of [LungMAP CellRef](https://research.cchmc.org/pbge/lunggens/CellRef/LungMapCellRef.html){:target="_blank"}, human and mouse lung single cell references using the LungMAP CellCards as a cell type dictionary to consolidate single-cell transcriptomic datasets of 104 human lungs and 17 mouse lung samples and identified 48 human and 40 mouse well-defined lung cell types catalogued from diverse anatomic locations and developmental time points.

## My Contribution
I have contributed to CellRef by serving as web developer and full-stack engineer while maintaining the current features and adding new ones. While maintaining the website I have taken on tasks traditionally assinged to both front-end and back-end developers.

I have been responsible for maintaining and updating the design of the site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Additionally I have been tasked with maintaining the lab group's databases housing the multimodal data. I have experience using SQL with Oracle to build and optimize queries.
